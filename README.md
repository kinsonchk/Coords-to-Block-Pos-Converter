==========

Technical details:

The user needs to provide:
1.  The real-world coordinate boundaries (in latitude and longitude format)
2.  The grid's boundary positions (top-left and bottom-right block positions)
3.	A target coordinate location in real-world units to convert

Using linear interpolation, the program calculates the equivalent block position by scaling longitude to the grid's X-axis and latitude (inverted north-to-south) to the grid's Z-axis.

This tool helps ensure accurate mapping between real-world locations and virtual grids, making it useful for projects such as building real-world map replicas or visualizing GPS data in a block-based environment.
